My previous suit was a little restrictive (its those gremlins in the closet who tighten your clothes) but having this one tailored meant that my sleeves and coat tail can be that little bit longer as they need to be and my jacket has an array of pockets for pens, business cards, phones and what not that all sneak into place.

Thanks again to Lords Custom Tailors for a great suit - look forward to the sports coat arriving soon.",

But the BEST news is that Jason Mirpuri is coming to Austin this weekend! 
Austin peeps, Jason travels to the states from Hong Kong a few times a year, and he'll be here in Austin THIS WEEKEND. He makes suits, shirts, dresses, jackets, and his fabrics will blow your mind. Let me know if you want some time with Jason while he's here, and I'll connect you.
